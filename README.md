Project Title: Key Signature
Project description: As every individual can be distinguished by a DNA which is unique to the person, likewise in the digital world, every single person has a rhythm of typing things using the keyboard. The time interval between the successive keystrokes can be defined as a unique signature and can help to identify the individual for security purposes. It can also be useful for finding patterns, detect intrusion, re-inventing literature works etc.

Proposed methodology/ resources: Project Development Approach: Agile Languages: Python, Java

Project Title: The Word Extant
Project description: For every jargon we encounter during reading a text on the internet or a word whose meaning is unknown, we always google it by opening a new tab. But this extension will display the meaning of the word as soon as you click on it. And its work does not end here, it will also provide related articles or incidents, videos and images to have a better understanding of the context. It is very much useful since it saves time and provide accurate data.

Proposed methodology/ resources: Project Development Approach: Agile. Languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Web etc.
