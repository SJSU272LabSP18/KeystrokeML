Project Title: Keystroke Signature

Project description: As every individual can be distinguished by a DNA which is unique to the person, likewise in the digital world, every single person has a particular rhythm of typing things using the keyboard.This is called behavioral biometrics and can be a valuabkle personal identifier. The time interval between the successive keystrokes can be defined as a unique signature and can help to identify the individual for security purposes. It augments the commonly implemented password authentication and can be used as part of a multilevel authentication scheme.It can also be useful for intrusion detection, fraud detection for online examinations etc.By harnessing the capabilities of Machine learning algorithms we demonstrate the use of keystroke biometrics in distinguishing Genuine users from Imposters.

Proposed methodology/ resources:  Languages used: Python, Java,
Jupyter Notebooks, IBM data services, IBM Watson Machine learning.
